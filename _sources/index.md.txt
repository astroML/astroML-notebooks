# AstroML Interactive Book


astroML is a Python module for machine learning and data mining that
accompanies the book
["Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy"](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691198309/statistics-data-mining-and-machine-learning-in-astronomy),
by Željko Ivezić, Andrew Connolly, Jacob Vanderplas, and Alex
Gray. astroML is built on numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and
astropy, and contains a growing library of statistical and machine
learning routines for analyzing astronomical data.

In this
[interactive book](https://github.com/astroML/astroML-notebooks) we
provide notebooks that describe the statistical and machine learning
methods used in astroML together with code that runs these methods on
existing astronomical data sets. The structure of this interactive
book follows the chapters of "Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine
Learning in Astronomy". Each notebook can viewed through the browser
(with navigation links at the side of the page), be downloaded to your
own computer, or be executed directly using
[Binder](https://mybinder.org) or
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
