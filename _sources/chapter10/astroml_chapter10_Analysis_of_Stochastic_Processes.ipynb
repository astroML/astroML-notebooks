    "The CAR(1) process is described by a stochastic differential equation which includes a damping\n",

    "\n",
    "hence, it is also known as damped random walk. In analogy with calling random walk \"drunkard's walk,\" damped random walk could\n",

    "Following $S_{ij} = \\sigma^2 exp(-|t_{ij} / \\tau|)$, the autocorrelation function for a damped random walk is\n",

    "$$ACF(t) = exp(-t/ \\tau)$$\n",

    "$$SF(t) = SF_{\\infty} [1-exp(-t/ \\tau)]^{1/2}$$\n",
